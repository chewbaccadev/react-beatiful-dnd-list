# Drag and drop sortable list

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, featuring [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd).

#  Info on the project:
This demo is meant to feature react-beautiful-dnd, which is a package made by [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/) and is a drag and drop package specifically built for lists. Adding some [Google Fonts icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons), some CSS in JS and CSS Modules, I started with [this example made by Atlassian](https://codesandbox.io/s/k260nyxq9v?file=/index.js) and had to add the TypeScript functionalities while making sure to also include an "Add" button for the list itself.

#  See it on Vercel!
This app was then directly deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) since it's fully compatible with Next.js:
